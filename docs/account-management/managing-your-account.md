[insert brief paragraph about account management here]

## Your account settings

[insert Authentik screenshot here]

Let's break down what each option does:

#### Username 
The name that identifies you when you use the Doghouse apps. Once you pick a username, it can't be changed.

#### Name
The name that acts as a "display name" for the Doghouse dashboard.

#### Email
The email address you used to create your account and use to sign in.

#### Profile picture
An image that shows in the upper-right corner of your Authentik dashboard and in some apps.

!!! tip
	To reset your profile picture, check **Reset profile picture** and click Save.

#### Access tier
This controls which parts of the Doghouse infrastructure your account can access. Learn more about access tiers [here](/account-management/access-tiers).

#### Support code
This is a code that allows us to perform actions on your account on your behalf. **Treat this code like a password and never share it with anyone**. If you have accidentally shared your support code somewhere, you can contact an administrator to have it reset.

#### Notifications
This controls which email notifications your account receives.
