# Deleting your Doghouse account

If you no longer have a need or want to use the apps at The Doghouse, you can delete your account to remove your data from our servers.

To do this, you will need to log in to your dashboard. Once you're logged in, click the cog in the upper right corner of the screen, then click **Delete account**. You will need to log in again to verify the action.

!!! note
    If you have lost access to the email account you used to create your Doghouse account, you will need to contact an administrator.

Deleting your account will do the following:

- Remove your access to the Doghouse apps (excluding access to Vaultwarden)
- Permanently delete your files and photos
- Remove your passwords and notes (if you opt to delete your Vaultwarden account)
- Clear your Jellyfin watch history

!!! tip
    If you delete your account accidentally, or want to cancel the deletion, click **Delete account** again and follow the prompts.

### Downloading your data

Once you request to delete your account, you will have 14 days to download your data before it is actually deleted. The date your account and data will be deleted is displayed on the confirmation screen, in the confirmation email, and in your user settings.

To do this, visit [this]() page.

You will have the option to pick what to download. 


## Deleting your Vaultwarden account

Since we consider your Vaultwarden account separate from the other apps, you will need to delete that in addition to deleting your Doghouse account.
